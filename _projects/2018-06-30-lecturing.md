From 2018-2020, I taught kids coding and IT under the auspices of IT Step Academy. Then came the coronavirus and my collaboration ended. Maybe I will return to tutoring again.

I taught children
- programming (Scratch/Code)
- 3D modelling
- basics of photography
- robotics (lego mindstorm)
- web development
