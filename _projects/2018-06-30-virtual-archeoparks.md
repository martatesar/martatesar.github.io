At startupjobs.cz, I reached out to Martin Ko코t'치l, a promising young archaeologist who has joined SmartUps. He had a vision to create a mobile app that would lure people to the place where the village used to be. That's how my collaboration began. First, I created a demo app that uses augmented reality and displays 3D models. At the archaeology conference, Martin Ko코t치l celebrated the success and we agreed to work together again.

*Augmented reality was also implemented, when the mobile phone was pointed at a drawing of the floor plan, a 3D model of the building was displayed.*
