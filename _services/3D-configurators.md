## 3D configurators
The configurator is a [3D application](/faq#concept-3dapplication){:target="_blank"}, which allows you to switch between product variants. It can be both a web and a mobile application. How to imagine it? Do you have a product and do you sell it in various color variants? This is exactly where the configurator will help you. The client tunes for himself what he likes. In addition, according to studies, people spend more time with the configurator than just with a picture, precisely because they play with it. Super is a combination, for example, with augmented reality, where the customer then displays the selected product directly at home.
