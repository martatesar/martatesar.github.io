## Your own suggestions?
Here are a few more areas I can create for you? But you can let your imagination run wild and come up with your own ideas for realisation. In a virtual environment there are no limits.

* Interactive presentations for exhibitions and conferences
* product presentations in an attractive environment
* tours of places that one cannot normally get to
* content for educational projects, entertaining and highly visual learning
* training and instructional applications, a new form of employee training
* games
* models of machines, equipment, cars, organisms, etc.

Possible technologies: 

* [virtual reality](/development/vr-apps)
* [augmented reality](/development/ar-apps)
* [3D web presentations](/development/3d-web-apps)
* [3D mobile presentations](/development/3D-mobile-apps)
