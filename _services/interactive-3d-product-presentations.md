## 3D product presentations

Looking for a way to present your products in a clear and fun way? 

* Present your product in a clear and fun way

Then I'm here for you. Customers understand your product best when they can experience it for themselves. But not everything can be taken with you to a potential client. Show them your product on a tablet, in [augmented reality](/faq#augmented-reality){:target="_blank"}, in [virtual reality](/faq#virtual-reality){:target="_blank"}, or right on your website in a browser. Both the tablet and the [VR Headset](/faq#vrheadset){:target="_blank"} can fit in your backpack, or even a smaller case. I'll also program the interaction with the product so that a future client can "feel" it.
