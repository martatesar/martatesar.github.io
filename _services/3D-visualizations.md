## Visualization of interior and exterior of the property
Experience the space as if you were inside or outside, walk around it, even look under the bed. Active [virtual reality](/faq#virtual-reality){:target="_blank"}, meaning your movement in virtual reality is as limited as in a traditional space, you can crouch, crawl or just walk. In addition, you hold the controllers that you use to interact with the virtual space. Don't want to learn with controllers? No problem, modern [virtual headsets](/faq#vrheadset){:target="_blank"} can recognize your hands. There's no more natural way to interact in virtual reality. Visualization of space is possible in augmented reality, but the experience is not as powerful as it is in virtual reality.
