## Virtual reality training applications
Do you have machines in your company that need training? I'll help you bring the machine into [virtual reality](/faq#virtual-reality){:target="_blank"} and the employee can learn to work on it without "screwing up". Virtual reality improves learning and even motor skills can be the same as on a real machine. Another example is firefighting. The video below is the only one not produced by me (they are Belgian), but I can create a similar simulation for you on request.
